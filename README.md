# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x_2=4
x_1=10
y_1=6
y_2=2
d=(x_2-x_1)**2+(y_2-y_1)**2
e=math.sqrt(d)
print(f'{e:.2f}')
```
